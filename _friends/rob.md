About me
===========

I'm from **Australia**. I teach old-fashioned, outdated courses like
*translation* and *functional grammar* and stuff at what used to be called the
*Dolmetscherinstitut* because we used to train interpreters here.

I'd like to learn
-------------------

* How to do statistical operations on linguistic data
* How to keep my work under version control

I could teach ...
--------------------

1. English
2. LaTeX
3. Systemic Functional Grammar
